# bookcarousel
Responsive carousel/slider styled as a 3D book. I am especially pround of pager animations on the bottom of the page which combine glitch effect achieved with pure CSS and SVG filter to create sticky liquid appearance. Dummy text. Animated background. CSS transforms to create the book itself. Can be used for multiple purposes on a website.
