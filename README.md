# bookcarousel
Responsive carousel/slider styled as a 3D book. I am especially proud of pager animations on the bottom of the page which combine glitch effect achieved with pure CSS and SVG filter to create sticky liquid appearance. Dummy text. Animated background. CSS transforms to create the book itself. Can be used as an image slider or a product preview for magazine/book.
